## Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)

- Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guide
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes

```python
def extract_claims(response: Response, company: dict) -> Iterator[SustainabilityClaimItem]:
    """
    Extract sustainability claims from HTML content.

    Args:
        response: Scrapy response object
        company: Company information dictionary

    Yields:
        SustainabilityClaimItem: Extracted claim items
    """
    # Implementation...
```

**Tools:**
```bash
# Format code
black backend/

# Lint code
flake8 backend/

# Type checking
mypy backend/

# Run all checks
make lint  # If Makefile is configured
```

### JavaScript/React (Frontend)

- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Keep components small and focused

```javascript
// Good
const CompanyCard = ({ company, onSelect }) => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div className="company-card">
      {/* Component content */}
    </div>
  );
};

// Bad
const comp = (props) => {
  return <div>{props.data.map(x => <span>{x}</span>)}</div>;
};
```

**Tools:**
```bash
# Lint code
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format

# Run all checks
npm run check
```
