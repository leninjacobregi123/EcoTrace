# EcoTrace - Demo Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Before Your Demo Tomorrow

Run these commands 10 minutes before your presentation:

---

## Step 1: Start All Services (2 minutes)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start databases (if not already running)
cd /home/lenin/IR_2025/ecotrace
docker-compose up -d

# Wait 30 seconds for databases to start
sleep 30

# Verify all containers running
docker ps
# Should show: elasticsearch, neo4j, mongodb, redis ✅
```

```bash
# Terminal 2: Start backend
cd /home/lenin/IR_2025/ecotrace/backend
source venv/bin/activate
python -m uvicorn api.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Look for: "Application startup complete" ✅
```

```bash
# Terminal 3: Start frontend
cd /home/lenin/IR_2025/ecotrace/frontend
npm run dev

# Look for: "VITE v5.4.21 ready" and "http://localhost:5173" ✅
```

---

## Step 2: Verify Everything Works (1 minute)

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health

# Should show all databases: true ✅

# Check frontend
curl -I http://localhost:5173

# Should show: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ✅
```

---

## Step 3: Open Browser Tabs (30 seconds)

Open these URLs in Chrome/Firefox:

1. **Main App**: http://localhost:5173
2. **Live Analysis**: http://localhost:5173/live-analysis
3. **API Docs** (optional): http://localhost:8000/api/docs

---

## Step 4: Test Live Crawler (2 minutes)

Before the audience arrives, do a quick test:

1. Go to: http://localhost:5173/live-analysis
2. Enter:
   - **Company Name**: Microsoft
   - **URL**: microsoft.com/sustainability
3. Click "Start Analysis"
4. Verify you see:
   - ✅ Status updates (PENDING → RUNNING)
   - ✅ Progress indicators
   - ✅ Eventually completes or shows helpful error

This ensures the live feature works during demo.

- URL: **microsoft.com/sustainability**

**Click** "Start Analysis"

**While it runs, explain**:

> "The system is now:
> - Crawling Microsoft's sustainability page

> - Running credibility analysis
> - Storing data in our multi-database architecture
> - You can see the progress updating in real-time every 2 seconds"

**Point out**:
- Status changing (PENDING → RUNNING)
- Pages crawled counter
- Claims found counter
- Current step description

**When complete**:

> "And it's done! The data has been saved to Elasticsearch for search, Neo4j for relationships, and MongoDB for structured queries."

**Show auto-redirect** to search results

**Navigate through all pages** to show the new data:
- Companies page: Microsoft updated
- Claims page: New Microsoft claims
- Graph: New relationships
- Analytics: Updated statistics

### Part 4: Search & Verification (2 min)

**Navigate to Search**:
- Search: "renewable energy"
- Show: Claims from multiple companies
- Click: View details

**Show**:
- Source verification
- Credibility scores
- Extracted dates and targets

---

### Part 5: Technical Architecture (Optional, 2 min)

> "Behind the scenes, EcoTrace uses:
> - **Scrapy** for ethical web crawling
> - **FastAPI** for high-performance APIs
> - **Multi-database architecture**: Elasticsearch, Neo4j, MongoDB
> - **React + Vite** for a modern, responsive UI
> - **Real-time WebSocket updates** for live progress
> - **NLP pattern matching** for claim extraction"

---

### Part 6: Q&A (5 min)

**Expected Questions & Answers**:

**Q**: What if a website blocks the crawler?

**A**: "Great question. Many companies use bot protection. When that happens, we show helpful error messages and suggestions - like trying their PDF sustainability reports instead. I can demonstrate that if you'd like."

**Q**: How accurate is the extraction?

**A**: "We use regex pattern matching to identify common claim formats like 'net zero by 2030' or '50% reduction by 2025'. The confidence scores reflect how certain we are about each claim. With full NLP enabled, accuracy improves further with semantic analysis."

**Q**: Can you analyze my company?

**A**: "Absolutely! Just enter your company name and sustainability page URL. The platform is designed to analyze any company's public environmental claims."

**Q**: Is this ready for production?

**A**: "Yes! After this demo, the platform is ready to deploy. There's no demo mode - everything you see uses real data extraction from real company websites. I have complete deployment documentation ready."

**Q**: How do you prevent abuse or overload?

**A**: "We have rate limiting in place, respect robots.txt, and use ethical crawling delays. For production, we can implement API keys, user authentication, and Celery task queues for high-volume operations."

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Crawler Takes Too Long

**Say**: "The website is quite large, so the crawler is taking its time. Let me cancel this and show you the existing data we've already collected from [company]."

**Do**: Click "Cancel" button, navigate to Companies page

---

### If Crawler Fails

**Say**: "Ah, this website has bot protection - common with sites like Patagonia. Let me show you the helpful error handling..."

**Point to**: Suggestions displayed in the error message

**Then**: "Let me show you our existing data instead" → Go to Companies page

---

### If Backend Crashes

**Remain Calm**:
1. Check terminal logs
2. Restart: `Ctrl+C` then `python -m uvicorn api.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
3. Wait 10 seconds
4. Continue with existing data tour

---

### If Frontend Crashes

**Remain Calm**:
1. Refresh browser: `Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R`
2. If still broken: `Ctrl+C` in terminal, then `npm run dev`
3. Continue demo
